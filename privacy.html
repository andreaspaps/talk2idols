        <h3>Privacy Policy:</h3>
          <ul><li>We don't collect or store any personal information or user data through the "talk2idols" app. Conversations with the AI chatbot are not recorded or stored. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting any information you provide while using the app.</li></ul>
          <ul>
      <li><p>Please note that while the "talk2idols" app itself does not collect or store user data, it relies on OpenAI's GPT-3 model and API for chatbot functionality. Therefore, when using the app, your interactions with the AI chatbot may be subject to OpenAI's data collection practices and privacy policy. We recommend reviewing OpenAI's terms of service and privacy policy to understand how they handle user data.</p></li>
      <li><p>As the developer of the "talk2idols" app, we do not have access to, collect, or store any information related to your conversations or interactions with the chatbot.</p></li>
      <li><p>This Privacy Policy only applies to the "talk2idols" app and does not cover any third-party services or websites that may be linked within the app.</p></li></ul>
      <h3>Functional Features and Paid/Free Functionality:</h3>

          <p>Go to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> and sign up for the free tier with a Google account, you may need to add a credit/debit card to activate the account. Google's text-to-speech offers 1 Million characters (200,000 words) free per month which is plenty for chatbot use and another 1M after for 3$.</p>
          <p>- Log in to your GCP account and navigate to the GCP console.<br>
          - Click on the project dropdown and create a new project or select an existing one.<br>

      <li><p>Click the "Clear API key" to remove the stored Keys from local storage in case you want to. Uninstalling the app automatically removes all stored keys. We do NOT collect any form of data as it is stored locally on the device.</p></li></ul>
          <h3>How to use:</h3>
          <ul><li><p>Tap "settings" (top right gear icon). During the initial setup, you only need to input the API keys and your name once, and they will be saved in the local storage.</p></li>
      <li><p>After obtaining the Key from OpenAI's website, copy-paste the key in the settings menu and you are ready to chat with the chatbot (type your question/anser in the "ask anything" input field).<li><p>To chat type into the "ask anything" input field and tap "submit" or tap the "speak" button to start the speech recognition. You must manually enable the app's "microphone permission" in your phone's "app permissions" setting.</p></li><li><p>Google's text-to-speech Key enables the chatbot to speak in both male and female voice.</p></li>
      <li><p>You can chat to the bot directly or you can insert the name of any famous person in the settings menu. The chatbot will reply as if it was that person.</p></li>
      <li><p>Tap the "refresh" button (top left icon) every time you choose a different personality in order to reset the memory.</p></li>
      <li><p>Starting with "/" in the "ask anything" input field mutes the chatbot's reply (only when text-to-voice is enabled).</p></li>
      <li><p>Starting with "Search" performs an internet search. You need a free Custom Google Search API key.
